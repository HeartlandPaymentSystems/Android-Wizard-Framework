Android-Wizard-Framework
========================

This is a simple framework for building wizard-like behavior into an android application.

WizardFramework: The framework. This includes resource files and so must be included as a linked project, not just a 
library in the libs folder.

WizardSample: A sample application that uses the wizard framework to give a short test and display the results.
